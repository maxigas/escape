# Chapter 1: What are socio-digital platforms?

## Outline

We approach socio-digital platforms on three levels:

1. As devices (apparatus) where the digital manifest in code in use.
   * This is important because materiality is often overlooked in more high-level discussions of platforms.
2. As socio-technical systems (large technological infrastructures Ã  la Hughes) or ecosystems involving standards, infrastructures from running code to development pipelines to office buildings, legal entitites from licences to companies, etc.
3. As specific political-economical formations, since GAFAM type companies achieved a particular (and particularly problematic) role in contemporary society.  Note: in this third sense at least, our main example, IRC, is not a platform!

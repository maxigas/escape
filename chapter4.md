# Chapter 4: What are the alternatives?

## Outline

* Opening gambit: Stephen Levy in 1984 already proclaimed “decentralisation” as the main demand of the hacker ethics.
* Start with Aaron Swartz’s ideas on the open web.
* Fediverse (Mastodon, etc.): [See what Roel Roscam Abbing is doing in terms of his Phd on the Fediverse!]
* IRC: We are not recommending it as a solution to the contemporary problems of social media – what we argue is that a prime example of alternative possiblities – and a good model to learn from for building better things then what exists today.  In fact the massive adoption of IRC today would probably destroy most of the good things we like about it.
* Reasons why people might turn to alternatives (by desire, or by necessity):
    + Srnicek says that advertising as a business model (which is powering half of GAFAM) is volatile, so that such companies will slowly switch to a subscription model, creating a two-tier Internet.
    + Milton Mueller says that Internet fragmentation might happen (also called Balkanisation, but that is a loaded term) - so that not all US capitalist services will be available everywhere all the time – as it is in fact true already today in places like China, etc.
    + Privacy discussions for data sovereignty?
    + Driven by network effects and peer pressure? → If alternatives will have more users.
    + Declining US hegemony and foreign policy would lead to regulation such as banning US social media monopolies from more countries?
* Gossip protocols: communication for a disconnected world (Islands on the Net)?
* Conclude with the notion that history is change, so something else will surely happen, platforms are not forever.

This case study does *not* necessarily recommend IRC as a medium of communication for activists, but rather seeks to put forward some theses on the history of technology that could be found useful in certain situations.

## From @Maxigas2017c

*The systematic study of historical cases may contribute to the refinement of a taste for critical technology adoption practices in communities who wish to keep control over the technologies that mediate their social relations.*  An appreciation of critique and recuperation in technological cycles may help to further technological sovereignty [@Hache2014d] over longer time frames, where local efforts could potentially become part of capitalist regimes of oppression and exploitation over time.  A corollary observation is that technical features may result in crucially different technological affordances depending on their context of use: this shows that pure techniques should never be promoted or rejected in themselves.

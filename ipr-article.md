# Introduction [400 words]

After a decade of growth and unquestioned pervasiveness in all walks of life, in recent years social media platforms have been subject to what can be called a "trust crisis". Trust in their ability to preserve privacy and the integrity of personal data, to prevent the spread of disinformation, to protect users against harrassment, and so on. The climax of this crisis is probaby epitomized by the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica episode and the following hearings of Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who was held accountable for these breaches of trust. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. From Google admitting that Gmail scans personal emails to extract commercially-valuable data, to Snapchat recognizing that supposedly ephemeral messages are stored, to Tinder admitting matching people based on a secret "desirability" score to Grinder being caught selling HIV-status information on its LGBTQ users, the ongoing question revolving around those platforms is always the same: can we trust them? How transparent are their algorithms? How fair are the values embedded in their design? How safe is the communicational space they are enabling? What data do they collect and store, and what do they do with them? 

This paper stems from a study of the historical shift from Internet protocols as commons to social media as platforms. We are interested in what we call the platformisation of social media, a gradual process by which digital communication devices based on open protocols and software got superseded by proprietary applications embedded within platforms. The core of our argument is that social media, as a category of communication devices, is not an emanation of (commercial) digital platforms, actually it predates them.     

The term social media is problematic. As Papacharissi puts it, “all media are social” and “invite [their] own form of sociality” (2015: 1). As a category, the term lacks a clear boundary. Further, using the phrase “social media” as a way to categorise a bound set of digital communication devices may be seen as a negation of the sociality fostered by other technological artifacts that existed prior to them. It pertains to the rhetoric of periodisation that has become commonplace in studies of digital media as the notion of newness has been instrumental in structuring the research agenda (Gitelman 2006; Park, Jankowski, and Jones 2011). Drawing attention to the most recent technologies contributes to framing already existing technologies as “old” in the derogatory sense of “obsolete” and “irrelevant”. It obscures (and denies) the possibility for users of technologies that are not in the spotlight of the largest public’s attention to contribute to a social critique of dominant technologies, overlooking their political and subversive potential.

By investigating all digital media in current use regardless of their “newness” nor the amplitude of their user base, we can see devices that enjoy continued use as legitimate technologies, rather than mere oddities surviving thanks to their users’ nostalgic attachments to obsoleted machines – as reported in Lindsay (2003) on retrocomputing. Dunbar-Hester’s work on low-power radio activism shows how political values attached to the understanding of media in continued use shape the appropriation of new technologies (2014). We would like to build on her arguments to show “how” contemporary use of “old” social media can inform a critique of new media. By “old” social media we mean pre-platform age digital communication protocols presenting what Hogan and Quan-Haase (2010: 310) call “social affordances”—notably many-to-many communication. An example of these is Internet Relay Chat, a long-standing protocol of real-time text conferencing.

While our relationship to technology is strongly structured around the modern myth of progress, it can be helpful to pay attention to users who go against the grain in their technological choices. In line with Edgerton’s (2008) plea for decentering our historical accounts of technology from innovations to uses, we focus on the IRC case and argue that this decentralised, co-constructed (Latzko-Toth, 2014) communication infrastructure continues to serve social groups who tend to distrust proprietary platforms—groups who are key to the collaborative production of software, hardware and politics.

# 2. Theoretical Framework [new 900 words, max 1000]

## 2.a For a use-centred social media history

Sally Wyatt challenges technological determinist assumptions in her work, such as that technological development goes hand-in-hand with social development. She [@Wyatt2008a 9] wrote about the *digital imperative*, a strong social expectation for people to adopt and pay attention to new technologies.  She calls continued users of old technologies *resisters* (“never had access and never wanted it”) and *rejecters* (“tried it but gave it up voluntarily”).  She identifies *rejecters* – those who continue to use old technologies, rather switch to new ones – as the user group most relevant to the critical study of adoption practices.  Rejecters have more agency than resisters in choosing which technologies to adopt.  Thus, the technological choices, adoption practices, and use patters of rejecters may be a good basis for the critical evaluation of technologies.

Furthermore, only a critical history of technological devices allows to shed light on contemporary debates about them.  Discussing these technologies as “new” obscures what is actually lost or gained with them.  This is in line with Edgerton’s [-@Edgerton2008a] plea for decentering our historical accounts of technology from innovations to uses.  *Use-centred* history of technology – as opposed to *innovation-centric* – is based not only on the invention date but historically specific about the use of the said technology, that is, who was using it, how long, for what purposes and to which effects.  It allows media scholars to theorise properties of devices stemming from their origins via path dependency as well as emergent properties that are gained through maintenance, development and a changing socio-technical context.  Therefore, `one has to` re-historicise studies of technological innovations.

In line with these insights, our study targets users of old technologies such as IRC, who would have plenty of alternative chat solutions to choose from (such as Slack, WhatsUp, etc.).  We frame these users as *rejecters* of new chat technologies and use their experience examine the IRC device from a *use-centric* perspective.  Our research question is about the possibilities of critical insights on communication technologies that studying rejecters from a use-centric perspective may offer.  Since pursuing such a project requires a particular kind of approach to the “history of the present”, in the next section we conceptualise the history of devices as technological cycles of critique and recuperation.

## 2.b Critique and recuperation in technological cycles

@BoltanskiChiapello2005a propose a theoretical framework where historical developments are analysed as an alternating series of critique and recuperation.  Their particular case involves the artistic critique of alienation in the 1960s through a wide-spread cycle of struggles and the associated desires it would unleash.  The critique of alienation was implemented by firm managers so that particular demands would be met at the same time as the main thrust of the critique would be derailed.

Anne Barron already showed how FLOSS — a social movement built around a technological artifact – went through such an ideological cycle from critique (free software) to recuperation (open source software).   Established as a critical response to the commodification of code that have been freely shared before by academics, amateurs and indeed, corporations, in a few decades FLOSS technologies became an organic part of capital accumulation practices in the IT industry.   While the demands of the free software community for code sharing (a critique of property rights) at that time were gradually accepted and implemented by major industrial actors and safeguarded by some of the most powerful nation states, its associated values paradoxically become the “ethical foundations of contemporary capitalism” [@Barron2013a 19].

Drawing the methodological moral of Barron’s results, @SoderbergDelfanti2015a suggest that the critique/recuperation framework is general enough to be applied to the study of different time frames, while it is especially attractive for hacker studies:

> Whereas Boltanski and Chiapello’s argument dwells on the evolution of organizational forms, they have little to say about the role of technology in the processes they describe.  Yet technical innovations spawned by hackers … constitute the material infrastructure of today’s capitalism.  [W]e argue for including hacking as one of the sources of the processes that constitute such infrastructure [@SoderbergDelfanti2015a 3].

Weaving these threads together, we suggest that the critique/recuperation framework of the pragmatic school can be applied to technological cycles over much tighter time frames.   With such a twist the framework becomes much more interesting for Science and Technology Studies, a field born from the intersection of the history and sociology of technology.   We propose that successive technological regimes are initially formulated as a critique of the present conditions, yet they fall prey to recuperation on their way to mass adoption.   Following @Liu2004a and @Fleming2009a who make a formally similar claim regarding “cool” and “authenticity” (respectively), we posit that the capitalist system feeds off the technological creativity at its fringes and makes use of the results for its own purposes.   Notably, such a conception can be understood as a politicised reading of the user-innovation phenomena described by @vonHippel2005a.   To tie its relevance to our empirical material, we refer to the observation that IRC today is mainly used by peer production communities: exactly the ones that exhibit the user-innovation dynamics analysed by von Hippel.

# 3. Methodology

Our claim that IRC serves as preferred communication infrastructure of peer production communities—a trusted commons—rests on the study of three specific user groups from the realms of software, hardware and politics. In software, we looked at the communication practices of FLOSS developers. In hardware, we investigated the media use of hackerspace members, since these shared machine workshops are considered the infrastructure of peer production “in the physical realm” (Kostakis, 2014). In politics, we examined the reported technological choices of participants in the Anonymous hacktivist group, since they have been the most visible example of peer produced politics of the last years (Dagdelen, 2012).

We structured the data collection and systematic analysis into three phases:

a)	The hypothesis was formulated based on our online and offline participative observation and historical ethnography. First author focused on the technical repertoire of hackers, while second author researched the social affordances of IRC networks. We noticed that the continued use of IRC constituted a routine practice in peer production communities while other user groups slowly but surely migrated away to more popular social media platforms over the years.

b)	Then, we used quantitative, computational methods to test the hypothesis. We collected data from community platforms about how to contact the respective peer production projects for support. We analysed the frequency of IRC as a contact option offered by the projects, versus other means of communication. We verified the results by correlating them with the names of these projects occurring in the list of IRC channels on popular networks (mainly freenode.org).

c)	Finally, we are completing a dozen semi-structured interviews with a diversity of users (casual and heavy users, server maintainers, developers) in order to 
contextualise and refine the results of the preliminary analysis. We use the findings from the quantitative phase as a prompt during the interviews.

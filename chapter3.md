# Chapter 3: Why to escape platforms?

## Outline

A taxonomy of (political) issues:

* Cognition-related issues: attention suckers, unconscious manipulation vs. informed consent [@Yeung2017a], cognitive skills weakened [@Hayles2007a]
* Privacy-related issues: numerous breaches, data sovereignty, surveillance capitalism: both business and governance model [@Zuboff2015a]
* Democracy-related issues: undermining democratic public sphere and national sovereignty [@Bratton2015b]
* Market-related issues: market concentration [@Srnicek2016a], anti-trust problematic, social media monopolies (because of network effects, falling transaction costs because of automation), US hegemony

## From @Maxigas2017c

The anxiety experienced by users stems from the fact that a supposedly informal space of social interaction is mediated by capital and overseen by the state, through mechanisms that seem obscure, arbitrary and partial from below.  One can remember that the two defining characteristics of a healthy *civil society* that can support technological sovereignty are its independence from capital and separation from the state [@Hache2014d].  It is *privacy* in a structural and collective sense that can be reclaimed through technological sovereignty initiatives, but only through the continuous struggle of users for taking the technological mediation of their social life into their own hands.

# Chapter 2: The platformisation of social media

## Outline

* Enclosure as part of platform dynamics (walled gardens, filter bubbles, etc.)
* From early social media through a tipping point of platformisation to 
* Key moments:
    + when IRCv3 protocol standardisation failed
    + Microsoft and Skype closing public chats
 * Explanatory factors:
    + Dissappearance of public infrastructures [@Plantin:Lagoze:Edwards:Sandvig2018a]
    + Moderation
    + Corporatisation
        - privatisation (not really public spaces because they belong to a private organisation)
        - the owner of the space is liable for anything that happens (moderation again)
        - is this why they moved from place-centred to people-centred social media?
        - dissappearance of multi-platform client
    + APIs, technical means and strategies of enclosure [@Helmond2015a; @Helmond+etal2019a]

Eventually, *surveillance* came to be the key means for both maintaining social peace and deepening exploitation on social media platforms. [^3]  Everyday, informal, even intimate gestures are captured and stored, sorted and mined for the purposes of both targeted advertising and targeted repression.  Such revenue is indispensable to the capital accumulation mechanisms of a growing section of capital, while the intelligence gained by authorities who share access to the information flows is essential to the maintenance of social order in both dictatorships *and* democracies.  For instance, surveillance – technically based on the analysis of log files – accounted for 89% of Google’s profit in 2014 [@Griffith2015a]. [^4]  All this hinges on successful *platformisation*: the ability of a vendor to install themselves as an obligatory passage point for generally mundane and often minuscule social interactions [@Gillespie2010a].  The kind of digital milieus where average Internet users chit-chat nowadays have been variously described by scholars as *enclosures*, *walled gardens* and *social media monopolies* [@LovinkRasch2013a].

The anxiety experienced by users stems from the fact that a supposedly informal space of social interaction is mediated by capital and overseen by the state, through mechanisms that seem obscure, arbitrary and partial from below.  One can remember that the two defining characteristics of a healthy *civil society* that can support technological sovereignty are its independence from capital and separation from the state [@Hache2014d].  It is *privacy* in a structural and collective sense that can be reclaimed through technological sovereignty initiatives, but only through the continuous struggle of users for taking the technological mediation of their social life into their own hands.

Notably, neither chat [@LatzkoToth2010a] nor personal computing [@Levy1984a] were “inventions” in the sense that a good idea was implemented and socialised through commodity circulation.  Both found a foothold in the market only after a relatively long period where fringe elements fought for them, often breaking existing laws, regulations and social norms.  Society then slowly tamed these technologies – and now they are used to pacify society itself.

# Chapter 2: The platformisation of social media

## Outline

* Enclosure as part of platform dynamics (walled gardens, filter bubbles, etc.)
* From early social media through a tipping point of platformisation to 
* Key moments:
    + when IRCv3 protocol standardisation failed
    + Microsoft and Skype closing public chats
 * Explanatory factors:
    + Moderation
    + Corporatisation
        - privatisation (not really public spaces because they belong to a private organisation)
        - the owner of the space is liable for anything that happens (moderation again)
        - is this why they moved from place-centred to people-centred social media?
        - dissappearance of multi-platform client
